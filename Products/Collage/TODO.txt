Issues, future features and refactoring
#######################################

* Add generic setup uninstall when its possible (the stonor way)

* Remove the CMF skin layer in favour of a Zope3/Five
  resourceDirectory. But DTML markup is not supported in resources.

* Simplify templates (refactor repeated KSS stuffs).

* Add a blacklist of content types (not compatible by nature with
  Collage). Edit this blacklist in a config panel.

* Limit number of columns in a config panel.

* Conflict with ARFilePreview on ATFile objects when editing through
  compose page.

* Views of subcontent should be optimized (more in Python view classes
  an less in templates).

* Fix doctest in viewlets.txt (lines 82/85)
