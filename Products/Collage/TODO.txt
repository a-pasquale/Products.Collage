  * Contained objects should have a different workflow. This could be
    accomplished with CMF Placeful Workflow.
	
  * Add example styles (views) for columns

  * Take measures to ensure that header-tags (h1, h2, h3...) are used
    consistently, even though we're using content templates that are
    designed for a single-page display.

    This will involve a full HTML-parsing.

    Alternatively, change to a viewlet-based rendering.
    
  * i18n!

  * Add generic setup uninstall when its possible (the stonor way)

  * Create browser folder (preparing for more utils and browser views) - change
    existing "browser.py" to a seperate (util / browser view) and move the interface
    stuff into the interface.
  
  * Clean up page templates move python code to some grouped browser views

    This is not easy; Plone leaves most of these things to templates since the
    functionality is based on a large number of acquisition-based scripts.
