Collage developer documentation
===============================

The Collage product was built to be easily customizable.

Content views
-------------

New content views can be added by registering a browser view with
a browser:page-directive. Examples of this can be found in

  ./browser/views.zcml

A view for a standard document can be registered as follows:
  
  <browser:page
     name="my-view"
     for="Products.ATContentTypes.content.document.ATDocument"
     permission="zope.Public"
     template="my-view-template.pt"
     class="Products.Collage.browser.views.BaseView"
     menu="collage-views"
     title="My View"
     />

Menu="collage-views" designates this browser page as a Collage view.
The title attribute determines the name of the view in Collage's list
of possible layouts.

You may, of course, use your own browser view class or no class at all.

Consider registering custom views for a browser layer so that they only
appear on Plone sites with your product installed, rather than all Plone
sites in the Zope instance.


Content controls
----------------

Content controls are registered as viewlets. See ./browser/viewlets.zcml
for examples.
