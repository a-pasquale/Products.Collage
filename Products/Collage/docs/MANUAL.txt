Collage manual
------------------

:: how to use

A Collage-object is a folderish object that lets users
create a layout built from individual content components.

After creating a new Collage-instance, you can navigate to
the 'manage page'-tab. This is the main interface for creating
pages.

At this step, you may either add a 'Row' or another type
of your choice using the standard add-item dropdown. You may
add as many items as you wish. They will be displayed one
after the other in rows.

The Row-object lets you create objects that are aligned
vertically. To add flexibility, we've introduced two types
that are unique to page rows: Alias and Column.

:: working with page aliases

A page alias is a content-type that wraps around an existing
content object (outside your Collage-instance). You can
use it for instance to display an existing smart folder,
even with a different layout (view) than the original item.

:: working with page columns

A page column extends the standard Document-type, provides
a view template suitable for display as a column and adds
an option to select multiple items to display in a listing.

For each column you can specify which fields will be shown.

Note that Smart Folders and normal Folders are given special
treatment. Instead of being displayed in the list, their
contents are added. This makes it easy to display various
catalog queries as a list in an easily customizable format.
